        <h2 class="articleTitleTypeface">Helvetica Font</h2>
        <p><strong>Helvetica</strong> or <strong>Neue Haas Grotesk</strong> is a widely used sans-serif typeface developed in 1957 by Swiss typeface designer 
            Max Miedinger with input from Eduard Hoffmann.</p>
        <p>Helvetica is a neo-grotesque design, one influenced by the famous 19th century typeface Akzidenz-Grotesk and other German and Swiss designs. Its 
            use became a hallmark of the International Typographic Style that emerged from the work of Swiss designers in the 1950s and ’60s,
            becoming one of the most popular typefaces of the 20th century.</p>
        <p>Notable features of Helvetica as originally designed include a high x-height, the termination of strokes on horizontal or vertical 
            lines and an unusually tight spacing between letters, which combine to give it a dense, solid appearance.</p>

            <h2 class="articleTitleTypeface">Verdana Font</h2>
            <p>Verdana is a humanist sans-serif typeface designed by Matthew Carter for Microsoft Corporation, with hand-hinting done by Thomas Rickner, then
                 at Monotype. Demand for such a typeface was recognized by Virginia Howlett of Microsoft’s typography group and commissioned by Steve Ballmer. 
                 The name “Verdana” is based on verdant (something green), and Ana (the name of Howlett’s eldest daughter).</p>
            <p>Bearing similarities to humanist sans-serif typefaces such as Frutiger, Verdana was designed to be readable at small sizes on the low-resolution 
                computer screens of the period. Like many designs of this type, Verdana has a large x-height (tall lower-case characters), with wider proportions 
                and looser letter-spacing than on print-orientated designs like Helvetica.</p>
            <p>The counters and apertures are wide, to keep strokes clearly separate from one another, and similarly-shaped letters are designed to appear clearly
                 different to increase legibility for body text. The bold weight is thicker than would be normal with fonts for print use, suiting the limitations of onscreen display. Carter has described spacing as an area he particularly worked on during the design process.</p>
